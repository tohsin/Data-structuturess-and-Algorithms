Consider the below problems statement.

There are 100 different types of caps each having a unique id from 1 to 100.
Also, there are ‘n’ persons each having a collection of a variable number of caps. 
One day all of these persons decide to go in a party wearing a cap but to look unique 
they decided that none of them will wear the same type of cap. 
So, count the total number of arrangements or ways such that none of them is 
wearing the same type of cap.

Constraints: 1 <= n <= 10
